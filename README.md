# preact-multiple-apps-poc

This repo should serve as a proof that it is possible to run two preact applications within the same document, even without separating them into an iframe.

Please inspect the git log to follow the steps how this has been created.

The result can be tested by running `npx serve client-page`.

> **Disclaimer:**
> This PoC is *explicitly not* in a state to be used as a starting point for building an application. It requires more careful setup and adjustments before this should be deployed anywhere.
